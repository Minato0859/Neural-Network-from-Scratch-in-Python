With the 2nd nuerons weight to a -, we now have a neuron that has an activation and deactivation point, whne both neurons are active, they produce values in the range of the granulae, variable, and output. If any neuron is inactive, the pair will produce non-variable output.\n",

    "We start with a neural network with 2 hidden layers of 8 neurons each and the layers are NOT densly connected (each N from 1rst connects omly to one N in the 2nd). The model takes 1 value as an input and 1 value as output, just like the sin curve. The output layer uses liner activation, and the hidden layers use rectified linear actvation function. We will now hand tune the Network:\n",
    "        \n",
    "        -Starting with the first/top pair. setting all (3) weights to 1 and all (2) biases to zero, the slope of the overall funtion is simply y=x\n",
    "\n",
    "        - Changing W1 to 6, the slopehas become very steep and now matches the first part of the sin curve. But this function never ends because the neuron pair never deactivates \n",
    "\n",
    "        - By changing B2 to 0.7, this offsets the overall function Vertically upwards\n",
    "\n",
    "        - Setting W2 to a negative number -1, this causes a deactivation point to occur horizontally\n",
    "\n",
    "        - The previous ajustment causes the line that was previously aligned with the sin function to flip over the x axis. In order to flip this slope back. We can take the final weight connected to the output neuron W3 and simply flip it to a -1\n",
    "\n",
    "        - Now all we want is to offset this up vertically. In this Hand optimization we are going to use the first 7 pairs of neurons to create the sin wave's shape and the bottom pair to offset everything vertically.\n",
    "\n",
    "        - Setting the bias of the 2nd neuron in the bottom pair to 1 and the W3 to 0.7 we can vertically shift the line.\n",
    "\n",
    "        - Moving on to the next pair of neurons: The 2nd pair of neurons' activation is beginning too soon. We must ajust the funtion horizontally and then increase the slope. This is done by Adding a bias B1 to -0.42 and chaning the W1 to 3.5\n",
    "\n",
    "        - Now we use the same logic used before with the first pair to set the DEACTIVATION point. This is done by switching W2 to a -1 (negative value essentially flips the activation function) and adding a b2 of 0.27 (function is shifted vertically upwards. The positive bias means that the second neuron starts producing a significant output at a lower input value, and this effect is then reflected in the combined output of the neuron pair. )\n",
    "\n",
    "        - Now we can flip this section's function same as we did before by setting the weight to the output neuron from 1 to -1 \n",
    "\n",
    "        - And again , just like the first pair we use the botton pair to offset \n",
    "\n",
    "        -Finally  , for the third pair of neurons , we only begin the activation for the 3rd pair of hidden layer neurons when we wish for the sop to start going down......We ajust where we want these things to start by the horizontal shifts and flips that we do to the W2 , the W2 turning into a negative creates the flip/deactivation point 'the funtion has become a quesiton of when this neuron deactivates\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we keep applying the same logic to the rest of the neuron pairs as we go trhough mapping the sin function. After passing data through the Network do we see how the neuron's areas of effect come into play--- only when bith neurons are activated. When we input 0.08 we see that its the top layer(the very begining of the sin function/close to zero which makes sense)."
